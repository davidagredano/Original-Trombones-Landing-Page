## WIP

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/) linked to a web address.

## TODO

2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles. (~10 min)
3. HTML Node Tree. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content. Write down a first draft of the website's semantic HTML tree in PUG indented syntax in a new .pug file that copiles into HTML. Research as much as necessary if not sure about the HTML semantics.
4. BEM Class Tree. Write down a first draft of the BEM class tree beside each HTML node in PUG syntax in the .pug file.
5. Website content. Add the actual written content and all the images on its corresponding node. Change or add anything necessary to the HTML node tree.
6. CSS variables. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
7. CSS styling. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on. Use the BEM Helper extension to generate the stylesheets. Use the SASS features needed: Variables (and maps), Mixins (with and without parameters) @include and @extend, Functions, Nesting, Composing (partials). Order of execution:

- (TODO) static mobile layout (mobile first)
- (TODO) mobile hover and active states
- (TODO) mobile navigation
- (TODO) static desktop layout
- (TODO) adjust styles when window expands above 1440px (to adjust: footer)
- (TODO) desktop hover and active states
- (TODO) revise desktop/mobile layout broken
- (TODO) style the transitional sizes (mobile < (this) < desktop)
- (TODO) clean up all comments in SCSS files

8. Interaction JS Scripts.
9. Testing and last touches (front end checklist)
10. All finished! Commit the final version to GitHub and deploy on GitHub Pages
